# The Actuary puzzle 508 - Square numbers

From the puzzle pages of June 2012 issue of The Actuary, I attempt to solve the
following puzzle making use of R

The approach I decided to take was to calculate a few relationships and work from there to attempt to find working solutions, instead of working out all necessary equations and completely solving. Although there can be probably be an exhaustive set of calculations leading to some form of order of size (and solution), any assumptions on size are based on size differences guaranteed by adjacent squares and following lines directly, not from comparing printed sizes, so this approach may be missing out on easily excluding some more impossible values this way.

## Initial rules:
Looking at the square and coming up with a few rules hoping to be exhaustive enough, where letter $x$ here is the value of the length of side on square $x$:

* Values are integers.
* Values are unique.
* $o > n$
* $m = n + o$
* $q = m + o$
* $l = m + q$
* $s = 0.25 * q \Rightarrow 4 | q$, as all values are integers.
    * Derivation: $t + s = l + q \Rightarrow (u + s) + s = l + q \Rightarrow u + 2s = l + q \Rightarrow (k + s) + 2s = l + q$
      * $\Rightarrow k + 3s = l + q \Rightarrow (l + s) + 3s = l + q \Rightarrow l + 4s = l + q$
	  * $\Rightarrow 4s = q$
* $k = l + s$
* $u = k + s$
* $t = u + s$
* $o < p < l - n$
* $r = l + t - n -p$
* $j = r - p$
* $i = j - p$
* $g = q + p - i - n - m$
* $f = g - n$
* $h = g - i$
* $e = i + j - h$
* $d = e - h$
* $c = d + e$
* $b = c + d$
* $a = b + f$

The set of numbers are also contrained by the fact that the total length of each side of the large square is consistent (will check this three ways):
* $a + b + c = u + t + r$
* $b + c = k + u$
* $b + t = k + e + j$

Also, the total area of the small squares should sum the total area of the large square:
* $(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 + g^2 + h^2 + i^2 + j^2 + k^2 + l^2 + m^2 + n^2 + o^2 + p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2 + t^2 + u^2$


#
# First decide on maximum values to take across our loops 
# Using loops here, despite inefficiency, for ease of understanding):
max_nn <- 20
max_oo <- 100

# Now set up the set of possible values for our first guess (in this case, square n)
possible_nn <- 2 * 1:{max_nn / 2}

# Instead of stopping the loop, will save the combinations in a list outside the loop: 
possible_solutions <- list()
i <- 1

# Now cycle through the possible values for n
for(nn in possible_nn) {
  possible_oo <- {nn + 1}:max_oo  # includes that o > n)
  for(oo in possible_oo) {
    mm <- nn + oo
	qq <- mm + oo
	if({qq %% 4} != 0) next
	ll <- mm + qq
	if(any(duplicated(c(nn, oo, mm, qq, ll)))) next
	ss <- qq / 4
	kk <- ll + ss
	uu <- kk + ss
	tt <- uu + ss
    if(any(duplicated(c(nn, oo, mm, qq, ll, ss, kk, uu, tt)))) next
	possible_p <- {oo + 1}:{ll - nn - 1} 
	possible_p <- possible_p[!{possible_p %in% c(nn, oo, mm, qq, ll, ss, kk, uu, tt)}] #uniques
	if(length(possible_p) == 0) next
	for(pp in possible_p) {
	  rr <- ll + tt - nn - pp
	  jj <- rr - pp
	  ii <- jj - pp
	  gg <- qq + pp - ii - nn - mm
	  ff <- gg - nn
	  hh <- gg - ii
	  ee <- ii + jj - hh
	  dd <- ee - hh
	  cc <- dd + ee
	  bb <- cc + dd
	  aa <- bb + ff
	  
      all_values <- c(
	    a = aa, b = bb, c = cc, d = dd, e = ee, f = ff, g = gg, h = hh, i = ii,
		j = jj, k = kk, l = ll, m = mm, n = nn, o = oo, p = pp, q = qq, r = rr,
		s = ss, t = tt, u = uu)
	    
	  if(any(duplicated(all_values))) next
	  if(aa + bb + cc != uu + tt + rr) next
	  if(bb + cc != kk + uu) next
	  if(bb + tt != kk + ee + jj) next

	  if({aa + bb + cc}^2 != sum(all_values^2)) next
	  
	  # if it's reached here, suits all of defined criteria (so possibly a solution)
	  possible_solutions[[i]] <- all_values
	    
	  print(possible_solutions[[i]])
	  i <- i + 1
	}
  }
}

print(possible_solutions)
saveRDS(possible_solutions, "c:/matt/temp/possible_solutions.rds")
possible_solutions <- readRDS("c:/matt/temp/possible_solutions.rds")
