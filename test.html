<p>From <a href="http://www.theactuary.com/puzzles-and-games/2012/the-actuary-puzzles-june-2012/">the puzzle pages of The Actuary June 2012</a>, I attempt to solve the following, making use of R:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This square contains exactly 21 smaller squares. Each of these smaller squares has sides of integer length, with no two smaller squares having sides of the same length. Can you fi nd a solution for the size of the 21 smaller squares? (Note, the 21st square, n, is between squares f, g, m and o).</p>
