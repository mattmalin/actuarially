# The Actuary July 2012 Puzzle 508 - Square numbers

## Square
Unfortunately the puzzle seems to not be downloadable to grab the actual puzzle.

Initial thoughts lead to the following rules (many of them):

size_of_square == a + b + c
size_of_square == a + b + d + e
a+b+d+e
a+f+g+h+e
a+f+g+i+j
k+l+m+n+g+h+e
k+l+m+n+g+i+j
k+l+q+p+j
k+l+m+o+p+j
k+l+q+p+j


Many simultaneous equations:
